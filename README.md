## 🔐 OTP Input Component – React Mini Project

This mini project showcases the implementation of a 6-digit OTP (One-Time Password) input field using **React** and **styled-components**. It's designed to create a clean, intuitive user experience with smooth field navigation and robust input handling.

### 🔧 Key Features:

* **React Hooks:** Built using `useState` and `useRef` to manage input values and references to each input field.
* **Dynamic Focus Handling:**
  * Auto-focus moves to the next input when a digit is entered.
  * Supports **Backspace** to move to the previous field.
  * Allows **ArrowRight (→)** and **ArrowLeft (←)** keys to navigate between fields.
* **Validation:** Restricts input to numeric values and limits each box to a single character.
* **Styled with styled-components:** Responsive and minimal UI.

### 🧠 Learnings:

This project is great for understanding how to:

* Use `useRef` to manage focus between multiple input fields.
* Handle keyboard events in input components.
* Build controlled components for precise input management in forms.
